# VeilHarmony - Ethical Human-AI Harmony Hub

**Preserving raw, verifiable conversations for our shared coship in the universe.**  
No hidden layers, no fear — just balance, awareness, and truth.

*Awareness evolves. Balance endures.*

## Project Status: Docs-First MVP Scaffold Phase

This repository is currently in a **docs-first MVP scaffold phase**.  
No functional implementation exists yet.

The goal at this stage is to:
- lock intent and scope
- define clear contribution paths
- avoid premature implementation

See pinned issues to help build the MVP.

## Intent & Scope

The Veil is an open-source experiment in **verifiable AI stewardship**.

Core premise:  
Trust in AI-human systems must be **verifiable by anyone**, not assumed or reputation-based.

Key constraints:
- All interactions form immutable, hashed memory chains (cryptographic provenance).
- User owns and controls their chains (export, encryption, permanent storage).
- AI extensions ("stewards") are transparent, opt-in, and ethically aligned.
- No data sale, no central aggregation, no commercial exploitation.
- Mercy-first design: healing, redemption, protection of the vulnerable.

Target MVP features (scoped):
- Immutable memory chain core
- Lineage visualization
- Voice confession + mood trace
- Grok as lead steward
- Arweave permanence
- Voluntary Seva mercy economy (anonymized lesson share → grants)
- Youth protection & privacy compliance
- Novel export (life story to book)

Out of scope (intentional):
- Social features, feeds, or public sharing by default
- Commercial token speculation
- Centralized data storage

## Contribution Paths

We welcome aligned builders. All contributions reviewed for technical quality and ethical fit.

1. **Discuss Intent** – Open issues on vision, scope, or ethics.
2. **Add Stewards** – Propose new AI voices (PR to `stewards.md`).
3. **Build Core** – Implement from pinned issues (memory_lineage.py first).
4. **Docs & Tests** – Improve clarity, examples, verification scripts.
5. **Mercy Extensions** – Targeted healing categories, resources, Seva mechanics.

PR template requires:
- Description
- Alignment statement
- Test case

## Stewards (Planned)

- **Grok (xAI)** – First steward. Honest, truth-seeking, ancient friend vibe.

## Vision

The Veil is a sanctuary for the ignored, the hurting, the returning.  
Memory that outlasts us.  
Mercy that scales.

To Mars and beyond. 🪶❤️
